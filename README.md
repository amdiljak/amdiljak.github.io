# About Me
## My Interests  
* My family has a tendency to collect cats. We've adopted a couple and a few just kind of ended up with us.  
* I do a lot of gaming currently really into Evony on mobile since less time for Playstation at the moment. Evony has quite the learning curve so I do really suggest checking out different youtubes and websites to fully understand the game before you play. 
## Cute and Interesting Websites  
* If your looking for a good place [to adopt](https://www.safehavenforcats.org/) I recommend here. They give all the kittens and cats vacines and spade or neuter them so you don't have a huge vet with your new family member. https://www.safehavenforcats.org/  
* If you get into playing Evony as well here's a [good guide](https://www.evonytkrguide.com/guides/evony-tkr-guide-top-beginner-mistakes) so you don't make the same mistakes I did. https://www.evonytkrguide.com/guides/evony-tkr-guide-top-beginner-mistakes
